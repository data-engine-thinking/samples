# Data Engine Thinking sample code

This repository complements [Data Engine Thinking](https://dataenginethinking.com/) by providing practical examples for implementing a flexible data solution. In the book, we often refer to our website -including this repository- to dive deeper into the technical aspects. This way, we aim to keep the book readable while still providing the level of technical detail we feel is necessary to developer data solutions the way we feel these should be implemented.
