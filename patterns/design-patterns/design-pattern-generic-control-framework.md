# Design Pattern - Generic - Control Framework

> [!WARNING]
> This design pattern is a placeholder awaiting content

## Purpose

This Design Pattern describes the reasoning for, and functionality provided by, a control framework for data logistics.

## Motivation

Data solutions rely on predictable, restartable, and auditable processing. Without a common control framework, individual pipelines implement their own tracking, leading to inconsistent failure handling, gaps in auditability, and higher operational cost. A shared control framework centralizes state, logging, alerting, and restart semantics so every pipeline behaves consistently.

## Applicability

This pattern is only applicable for _every_ process in the data solution.

## Structure

The control framework typically provides:

* **Orchestration and state**: job definitions, dependencies, run states, and restart markers to guarantee idempotent runs.
* **Audit and lineage**: capture of row counts, checksums, timestamps, source/target identifiers, and lineage links for traceability.
* **Exception handling hooks**: standard outcomes for continue/reject/abort, plus routing into exception stores.
* **Observability**: centralized logging, metrics, and alerts for SLA tracking and incident response.
* **Access control**: role-based access for operators, developers, and auditors.

## Implementation guidelines

* Standardize job metadata (run id, batch/window, source/target, row counts, checksums) and persist it per load.
* Enforce restartability: every step should be idempotent and able to resume from the last committed state using the control metadata.
* Define clear outcomes (success, partial with exceptions, failed) and route exceptions to a common store with enough detail to remediate.
* Provide SLA tracking and alerting on latency, freshness, and failures; avoid bespoke alert logic per job.
* Separate control-plane storage from data-plane storage to reduce blast radius and simplify recovery.
* Keep the framework technology-agnostic where possible so it can front multiple data logistics/ELT engines.

## Considerations and consequences

* A control framework adds upfront implementation effort but reduces long-term operational toil.
* Centralization creates a dependency; design for high availability and clear fallback/runbook procedures.
* Excessive coupling to a specific engine or scheduler reduces portability; keep interfaces minimal and documented.
