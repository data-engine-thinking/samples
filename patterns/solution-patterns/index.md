# Solution Patterns

Solution Patterns document the practical details on how to implement Design Pattern concepts explained for a given technology. In many cases a single Design Pattern is referred to by multiple Solution Patterns, all of which document how to implement the concept for a specific technology.

Every Solution Pattern uses the shared structure outlined in [Pattern Structure](../pattern-structure.md) to keep purpose, motivation, applicability, structure, implementation guidelines, considerations and related patterns consistently presented.
