# Landing area pattern

The Landing Area serves as the first point of arrival for data entering the data solution. It provides a staging zone where source data is captured in its raw form before any transformation or cleansing occurs.

Key characteristics of the Landing Area:

- Preserves source data in its original format
- Captures metadata such as inscription timestamps and record sources
- Enables recovery and reprocessing of source data
- Supports delta detection and change data capture
