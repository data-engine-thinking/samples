## Available Frameworks

### DIRECT

The [DIRECT Framework](https://github.com/data-solution-automation-engine/DIRECT) closely follows the concepts described in Data Engine Thinking.

The current version is largely geared towards Microsoft-family databases but has been widely adopted and in-use for more than 15 years. Development is ongoing, for instance to implement a more API-driven approach for further interoperability with different data platforms.

The repository comes with installers via database projects and/or scripts.
