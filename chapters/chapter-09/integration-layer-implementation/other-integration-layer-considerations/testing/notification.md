# Notification

Notifications provide alerting mechanisms within the control framework to inform operators and systems about important events during data loading operations. Effective notification ensures timely awareness of issues, completions, and anomalies.

Key notification scenarios:

- Load completion or failure alerts
- Data quality threshold breaches
- Schema drift detection
- Performance degradation warnings
- Referential integrity violations

Notifications can be delivered through various channels including email, messaging systems, logging frameworks, or integration with monitoring platforms.
