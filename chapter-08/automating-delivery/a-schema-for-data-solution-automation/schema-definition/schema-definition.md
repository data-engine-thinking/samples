## Frameworks

The repository for the schema for data solution automation is available in the [data solution automation schema](https://github.com/data-solution-automation-engine/data-warehouse-automation-metadata-schema) repository.

This repository includes:

* The JSON schema definition
* A Class Library (DataWarehouseAutomation) containing the object model for deserialization, as well as various utility classes such as validation of files against the jSON schema definition.
* Code examples (examples_handlebars), containing C# examples using the generic interface for various purposes.
* Regression test project (test_project)

## Adoption In Software

The documentation pages for Agnostic Data Labs (ADL) contain a [complete description of the schema](https://data-solution-automation-engine.github.io/data-warehouse-automation-metadata-schema/) as applied in the software - including the [Class Library](https://data-solution-automation-engine.github.io/data-warehouse-automation-metadata-schema/api/DataWarehouseAutomation.DwaModel.html).
