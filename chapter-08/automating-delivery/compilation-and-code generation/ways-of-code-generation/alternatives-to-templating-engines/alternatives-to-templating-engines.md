# Templating Engines

This section provides resources for further working with templating engines.

## Frameworks

An easy way to start working with templating engines, is to download the [Schema for Data Solution automation](https://github.com/data-solution-automation-engine/data-warehouse-automation-metadata-schema) repository and execute/modify the examples made available here.

## Software

* [Agnostic Data Labs (ADL)](https://agnosticdatalabs.com/) is a new data automation solution that follows the concepts and patterns described in Data Engine Thinking. It requires registration, but provides a convenient user interface to simplify working with templates - and provides a large repository of runnable samples.
