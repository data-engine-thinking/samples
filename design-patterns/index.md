# Design Patterns

Design Patterns provide documentation of key design decisions and backgrounds on design principles: the conceptual 'how-to's' that capture intent and reasoning. This includes the application of data integration and Modeling concepts.

Every Design Pattern follows the common layout described in [Pattern Structure](../pattern-structure.md) so readers can quickly find the title, purpose, motivation, applicability, structure, implementation guidelines, considerations and related patterns.
