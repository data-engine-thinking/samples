# Managing temporality by using Inscription, Source and Change timestamps

## Purpose

This Design Pattern describes how and when timestamps are generated and used by the data solution to track temporal changes.

## Motivation

Making sure that the data is valid for a period of time is a core functionality of the data solution. Data is only accurate when a specific value in the period of time (interval) reflects the reality of events - this is a fundamental requirement for auditability and lineage. For this reason care must be taken when using system generated timestamp values to indicate when a value (row) is valid and to track whether the value has been changed in the providing source systems.

This is also known as:

* Effective and Expiry Dates.
* Start and End Dates.
* Slowly Changing Dimension valid period.
* Assertion and State Timelines.
* Temporality, Time-Variance.

## Applicability

This pattern is applicable for all data logistics processes in the data solution, but is more standardized in the Staging Layer and the Integration Layer. Timestamps are typically inherited or re-calculated into the Presentation Layer as well but since this is essentially a free-format layer this decision is left open for individual projects.

## Structure

The essence of this Design Pattern is to identify a timestamp for every data set in the Landing Area and use the same timestamp value onwards through the Integration Layer processes. In other words; the registration of timestamp in the data solution is decoupled from when the data logistics is actually run for the rest of the data solution. There are three main timestamps that can be considered as standard:

* The **Inscription timestamp** (assertion timeline), when the change was received by the data solution environment. This is logged at the first entry of data, usually the Staging or Persistent Staging Areas.
* The **Source timestamp** (state timeline), when the change was made in the source / feeding system (also almost the same as CDC timestamp, although there are cases where the actual event of change differs from the change detection). This is embedded into source-to-staging (CDC) loading patterns. The method to determine the best source timestamp varies from interface to interface but never is a source attribute (except for initial loads).
* The **data logistics Execution timestamp**, when the data integration process was run that touched the record(s). This is implemented in the data logistics control Framework (DIRECT).

It is important to clarify there are many other timestamp values available which can be used to represent data (changes) over time - these are considered 'business' timestamps and are treated as regular data attributes. In some cases, these can be identified as a calculated Business Change timestamp attribute which can sometimes be used for standardization.

The inscription timestamp is the only value that can be systematically relied on, to provide a deterministic timestamp field which is decoupled from loading processes.
As defined in the Staging Layer Design Pattern, one of the most important features of the Staging Layer is capturing the inscription timestamp and identifying the best source timestamp for each (type of) interface. As a technical data element, the inscription timestamp ensures that there is a unique version of the record for each time interval.

This is different from the regular data logistics process execution and orchestration (DIRECT) controls which manage the information about the data logistics process itself. Individual execution timestamps are still available for the data solution by querying the control framework for the unique data logistics execution ID associated with the records. By combining these concepts the data solution can identify both when information was loaded and the correct time interval for which the information is valid.

After the Staging Layer has been loaded the subsequent Integration Area data logistics processes use the inscription timestamp value for managing effective and expiry dates (in all their occurrences).

For a detailed explanation of the assertion and state timeline concepts, see [Assertion and State Timelines](xref:design-pattern-generic-assertion-and-state-timelines).

## Implementation guidelines

* Use high precision timestamps to support batch and near-real-time schedules.
* Set inscription timestamp at first landing (Staging/PSA) and propagate; treat it as the effective date in Integration.
* Derive source timestamp from CDC/log markers where available; avoid trusting source business timestamps for technical validity.
* Avoid NULL end dates by using a standard high-value expiry or derive expiry from the next effective date; recalculate business timelines in Presentation as needed.
* PSA loads typically skip expiry updates for performance; the inscription timestamp forms part of the key.

## Considerations and consequences

* Dependencies that are introduced by the loading strategy must be kept in mind. For instance: Integration Layer processes should be completed before the next Staging Layer data logistics runs. If not, the new batch might overwrite any values in the Landing Area table and the wrong timestamp will be used. This is one of the reasons why the standard Batch process includes both the Staging and Integration data logistics processes.
* Decoupling Data Warehouse timelines with process control (system timestamps) means that the data logistics will provide the same results regardless of when it is executed.
