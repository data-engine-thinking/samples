# Fidelity

Fidelity in the context of snapshots refers to the accuracy and precision with which temporal data is represented. High fidelity snapshots preserve the exact timing of changes, while lower fidelity approaches may introduce approximations for efficiency.

Key fidelity considerations:

- Precision of temporal boundaries in snapshot generation
- Trade-offs between accuracy and storage/performance
- Impact on downstream analytical accuracy
- Alignment with business reporting requirements
