# Running A Sample Template

When run from the directory where the executable resides, running the below command in a terminal or command-line will result in a simple SQL statement - as directed by the template!

```dotnetcli
rundwhAutomation -i .\sample_metadata\myFirstMapping.json -p .\sample_templates\myFirstTemplate.handlebars -v
```
